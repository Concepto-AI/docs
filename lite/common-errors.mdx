</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Could not generate a design from your sketch" icon="comment-question" iconType="solid">
    Basically, the AI has no clue what you are trying to make. Is it a wireframe? Remember that it has to be a website that the AI can code. Make it clearer.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Could not contact OpenAI" icon="message-slash" iconType="solid">
    This error means that your computer couldn't talk to OpenAI.
    Try this:
    - Waiting 10 minutes
    - Turning your internet connection off & on
    If you're in an area where apps like ChatGPT are blocked, you're probably not going to be able to use Concepto AI.
