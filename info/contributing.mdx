We welcome contributions of any size and contributors of any skill level.
As an open source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors.
We are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

<Note>Take a look at [GitHub's Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for helpful information on working with GitHub.</Note>

## Types of contributions

There are lots of ways to contribute to Concepto AI.

Help writing docs, catching typos and errors, as well as translating docs into other languages is always welcome.

You can also get involved by leaving feedback on [issues](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/issues) or reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/pulls) by other contributors.

We encourage you to:

- [**Open an issue**](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/issues/new) to let us know of bugs in Concepto, documentation you found unclear, or other issues you run into.

- [**Look at existing issues**](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/issues) to debug any errors, or to get inspo to contribute.

- [**Make a pull request (PR)**](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/pulls/new) to address an open issue or to fix obvious problems.

- [**Review existing PRs**](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/pulls) to help us merge contributions sooner.

- [**Add or update translations**](https://concepto-docs.vercel.app/about/contributing/#translations). We need help translating both Conceptoâ€™s UI and documentation.

### Setting up a development environment

You can [develop locally](#developing-locally) or use an online coding development environment like [GitHub Codespaces](#developing-using-github-codespaces) to get started quickly.

#### Developing locally

**Prerequisites:** Developing Concepto AI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v16 or higher) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Make sure you have these installed before following these steps. If you're developing new AI tools, you may need an OpenAI Developer API Key.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Concepto Docs">

The dev container used for GitHub Codespaces can also be used with [other supporting tools](https://containers.dev/supporting), including VS Code.


## Testing

### Testing visual changes while you work

Run the dev server on the docs site to see how changes you make impact a project using Concepto.

To do this, open up your terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and then run `pnpm dev`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should then be able to open `<http://localhost:4321>` or `<http://localhost:3000>` and see your changes.
