We welcome contributions of any size and contributors of any skill level.
As an open source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors.
We are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

<Note>Take a look at [GitHub's Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for helpful information on working with GitHub.</Note>

## Types of contributions

There are lots of ways to contribute to Concepto AI.

Help writing docs, catching typos and errors, as well as translating docs into other languages is always welcome.

You can also get involved by leaving feedback on [issues](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/issues) or reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/pulls) by other contributors.

We encourage you to:

- [**Open an issue**](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/issues/new) to let us know of bugs in Concepto, documentation you found unclear, or other issues you run into.

- [**Look at existing issues**](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/issues) to debug any errors, or to get inspo to contribute.

- [**Make a pull request (PR)**](https://github.com/concepto-ai/app/pulls/new) to address an open issue or to fix obvious problems.

- [**Review existing PRs**](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/pulls) to help us merge contributions sooner.

- [**Add or update translations**](https://concepto-docs.vercel.app/about/contributing/#translations). We need help translating both Concepto’s UI and documentation.

### Setting up a development environment

You can [develop locally](#developing-locally) or use an online coding development environment like [GitHub Codespaces](#developing-using-github-codespaces) to get started quickly.

#### Developing locally

**Prerequisites:** Developing Concepto AI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v16 or higher) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Make sure you have these installed before following these steps. If you're developing new AI tools, you may need an OpenAI Developer API Key.

#### Developing using GitHub Codespaces

**Create a new codespace** for

    [Create new Concepto Codespace](https://codespaces.new/concepto-ai/app)
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Concepto Docs">
    [Create new Concepto Docs Codespace](https://codespaces.new/concepto-ai/docs)
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

The dev container used for GitHub Codespaces can also be used with [other supporting tools](https://containers.dev/supporting), including VS Code.


## Testing

### Testing visual changes while you work

Run the dev server on the docs site to see how changes you make impact a project using Concepto.

To do this, open up your terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and then run `pnpm dev`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should then be able to open `<http://localhost:4321>` or `<http://localhost:3000>` and see your changes.

## Translations

Translations help make Concepto Docs accessible to more people.

### Translating Concepto AI's UI

Concepto’s UI comes with some built-in text elements. For example, the `Concepto it`, which needs translating.

### Translating Concepto AI’s docs

Concepto AI’s documentation is also translated into multiple languages. You can find the source code for the site in the `src` folder of this repository.

Help out by:

- Reviewing [open translation PRs]((https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/pulls)
- Updating out-of-date translated pages
- Adding an untranslated page

#### Adding a new language to Concepto’s docs

To add a language, you will need its BCP-47 tag and a label. See [“Adding a new language”](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/contributor-guides/translating-astro-docs.md#adding-a-new-language) in the Astro docs repo for some helpful tips around choosing these.

- Add your language to the `locales` config in `docs/astro.config.mjs`
- Create the first translated page for your language.  
   This must be the Concepto landing page: `docs/src/content/docs/{language}/index.mdx`.
- Open a pull request on GitHub to add your changes to Concepto Docs!
