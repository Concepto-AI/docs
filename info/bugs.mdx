Aah! You found a bug? let us know and we'll squash it.

## Developer Report
If you know what you're doing, it would be stellar if you could make an issue report on the [concepto-ai/discussions](https://github.com/concepto-ai/discussions/issues/new) repo. We'll triage it for you, and update our [status](https://status.conceptoai.app) ~~if~~ when we find a fix.

## General Report
Not a developer? Not to worry - we'll help you solve your issue. To make our lives easier it would be great if you could give us these pieces of information before you email/chat with us.
1. A detailed description of **what** went wrong
2. How you can reproduce this issue (make it happen again)
3. What device, browser, and version of Concepto AI you're using (cloud, self-hosted, lite)
4. A screen-recording or screen-grab of the issue you're encountering.

<Note>Before you submit a report, it would be much appreciated if you could just check our [Status](https://status.conceptoai.app) to make sure we're not already fixing it.</Note>
